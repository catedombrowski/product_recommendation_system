# Crowdsourced Recommender System for Beer Recommendations

### Project Overview
In this project, we developed a crowdsourced recommender system by leveraging customer review data. Our goal was to provide personalized beer recommendations based on consumer preferences and the attributes of different beers.

### Methodology

1. Data Collection: We scraped a webpage to gather a comprehensive dataset of customer reviews for various beers.

2. Data Analysis: We performed in-depth analysis of the reviews to identify the most commonly mentioned attributes of each beer, as well as the sentiment associated with these attributes.

3. Recommendation Engine: By matching the identified beer attributes with consumer preferences, we created a recommender system that suggests beers with similar characteristics.

### Business Applications
This project has a wide range of applications in the business world, particularly in industries where personalized recommendations can enhance the customer experience and drive sales. Some potential applications include:

-E-commerce Platforms: Integrating the recommender system into online marketplaces to suggest products based on user reviews and preferences.

-Subscription Services: Offering personalized subscription boxes by recommending products that match the subscriber's taste profile.
   
### Conclusion
By analyzing unstructured review data, we have successfully created a recommender system that provides personalized beer recommendations. This system can be adapted and applied to various business contexts, offering a valuable tool for enhancing customer satisfaction and engagement.
